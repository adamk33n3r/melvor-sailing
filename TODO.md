# Things to do before v2 release

+ Check that ships are properly upgraded to docks
  - specifically make sure the locked status, upgrades, and the mastery level/xp are transfered

# v2.1
- crafting skill ports (herblore, crafting, smithing, etc)
- save "trip data" like selected port, current stats, current ship upgrades, etc. cause right now you can upgrade them mid trip and it will count
